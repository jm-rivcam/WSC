# WWinDS

WWinDS (WHC0_1) is an open source program to calculate the spectra of the waves at a given wind velocity and fetch. The program writes the wave spectra values into several .txt files. This will also include plots of the spectra in .png format. It has two versions, one using GTK4+ containers to show the plots that ends with a p or in this case
"WHC0_1p.zip" and one that just calculates and stores the results "WHC0_1.zip".

Each spectra is calculated using a data stream from a text file that will produce an (x,y) output file and the plots.

The process of use, installation and general description of the program along with its GPl license and example data y located at the .zip file in WHC0_1p.zip, to know more just go to the docs section in the unzipped folder!.
