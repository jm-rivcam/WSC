ed Future work:

Version 0.1 and 0.1p: 
-Calculation of the wind spectrum of a full developed state with wind corrections from the zone at different atmospheric stabilitiy approximations. ->Done!, revising upward wind velocity profile calculations for wind corrections in the inferior layer of the sea/atmosphere boundary.
-Two version code to use plplot at a library to create the spectrum plots. ->GTK4 was added to show the calculations of the spectrums!.
-Insertion of data streams as defined by the NDBC system sampling methods as used by the NOAA. -> In the making!, will be implemented using an dummy ATMEL controller.
-Extraction of the wave model conditions using a set of relationships to depict underwater wave weather conditions. ->In the making!, will be later connected to blaktern.

Version 0.2 and 0.2p: 
-Calculation of the wind spectrum that depends on the local area of propagation depending on the area and time of the wind blowing.
-Local geographical location using latitude and longitude coordinates for a given system streamming data.


Version 0.3 and 0.3p: 
-Calculation of the wind spectrum at a two spectrum system given a far field and close field, using two wave field components.
-Retrieve data from two different systems averaging its conditions on time and space and calculating its fetch vs time conditions.


Version 0.4 and 0.4p: 
-Calculation of the wind spectrum at a multi variable spectrum system given a far field, regional field and close wind field, using three wave field components.


Version 0.5 and 0.5p: 
-Calculation of the wind spectrum at a multi variable spectrum on a multi device system with contributions given by the averaging system at differente area and time scales.



Version 0.6 and 0.6p: 
-Calculation of the wind spectrum at a multi variable spectrum on a multi device system with contributions given by the averaging system at differente area and time scales.
